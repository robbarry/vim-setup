# vim-setup

This is Rob's portable vim setup. Presented without warranty, with the strong caveat that I have no idea what I'm doing.

Note that if you already have a .vimrc file, this will **overwrite** it.

## Installation

**Step 1:**

```
git clone git@github.com:robbarry/vim-setup.git ~/.vim --recursive
echo "source ~/.vim/vimrc.vim" > ~/.vimrc
``` 

**Step 2:**

Load vim and run `:PluginInstall`
